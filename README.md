# ISO RELAX

This repository contains code originally imported from the iso-relax CVS
repository hosted on [SourceForge].

Files and patches that are used for RPM packaging in fedora have been added on
top. Additionally, the project has been ported from `ant` to `maven`, while
preserving the structure and contents of the generated `JAR` file as far as
possible.
